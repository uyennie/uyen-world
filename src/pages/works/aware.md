Amply aims to significantly reduce textile waste by connecting op shops, re-sellers, and customers on a centralised platform. By rescuing surplus items, providing economic opportunities for re-sellers, and offering sustainable shopping options, the project contributes to a more circular and responsible fashion ecosystem.
