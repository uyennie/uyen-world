d.selfhood, or, I Have Seen Everything Except Myself is a publication that acts as a formal continuation of the [CONTENT?] website series. It focuses on the idea that technology isnâ€™t simply just going to go away even as we make a conscious decision to avoid it, and that an algorithm can never truly replicate a human.

Containing my own writing as well as various articles and essays on the topic of digital selfhood, the publication aims to give insight on the complexity of existing online and provides alternatives to cultivate a more mindful digital experience.

The publication is printed on EcoStar recycled 120gsm.
