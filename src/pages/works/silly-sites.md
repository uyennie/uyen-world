## silly sites

`Oct 2022`

## What is a silly site/digital garden?
silly sites are what I like to call my web explorations where I practice my fundamental HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.

My digital garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites "should be.” It's an ethos that is both classically old and newly imagined.

>**Gardens are...**
>1. **Explorable**, rather than structured as a strictly linear steam of posts. This is usually achieved through deeply interlinking notes where readers can navigate freely through the content.
>2. **Slowly grown over time**, rather than creating "finished" work that you never touch again. You revise, update, and change your ideas as they develop, and ideally find a way to indicate the "done-ness" state to your reader.

No framework, platform, plug-in, service, or fun interface element defines a garden, and never will. Do whatever works for you, at whatever technical level feels comfortable. Just keep gardening 🪴

## Eye Trail
Rewatched a performance of Swan Lake and was inspired by dance, ballet and the animation technique of rotoscoping. This is a small little experiment where I learned p5.js for the first time. The prompt: if eyes could dance!

## Free Them
Journalling; but I get to see my thoughts float away in a cloud towards the sky on the internet.

## Inspirations
A little site I made after I was asked "Who inspires you?" at a job interview.
