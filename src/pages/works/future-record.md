## Future Record

Honing on the idea of how digital waste is often left hidden to the human eye, Future Record is a project which aims to to visualise what this waste might look like if it was a 3D object with size and mass; creating an archive of the computer's forgotten dumpster. The concept draws inspiration from Timothy Morton's Hyperobject and the hypothetical global catastrophic scenario of the Grey Goo.
