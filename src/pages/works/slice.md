# How can we lower the barriers and warmly welcome more people to get started designing?

## The challenge

> Grab your sleeping bag, some bug spray, and a laptop ‚Äî We‚Äôre going (virtual) camping üèï
Camp Figma is a design jam run by the UI/UX community at MADA (Monash Art, Design and Architecture). 

For this challenge, we were given the prompt to **‚ÄòMake design more accessible‚Äô**, while considering the question: How can we help newer designers level up? 

## The prompt
Given the ambiguous nature of the prompt, we knew that we would have to think outside of the box and explore more ambitious ideas. We had to step outside our comfort zones to create an innovative, feasible, and inclusive plugin, while also keeping it simple enough to be completed in just over 48 hours.

## My role

Within a team of 3, my role in this project covers:
- UX Research
- UI Design

`Phase One`
# Navigating the problem space üß≠

## What would a new designer feel?
The first step of our design process was discovering the given problem area and defining a problem statement. As a group of aspiring junior designers ourselves, we looked back on our personal experiences when getting into the design industry. Though this exercise, we realised that there were varying pain points depending on an individual‚Äôs level of experience. Using a **jobs-to-be-done framework**, we identified two main gaps in the journey of becoming a designer:

1. As a new designer, how can I refine and level up my toolkit?
2. As someone whose never designed before, how do I get started?

## Brainstorming

Under these two categories, we collectively held a **two hour brainstorming session** to come up with themes to answer the above questions. From learning about the step-by-step design process to figuring out how to ‚Äúask the right questions‚Äù, we leaned heavily on bouncing ideas between each other while conjuring up our own experiences.

Through a collaborative voting process, we decided that the underlying theme for many of these pain points was **getting over imposter syndrome** and **learning how to gain confidence** as a designer.

## Defining our route üöò

While there are many ways in which people can overcome imposter syndrome, we all agreed that it was vital for new designers to focus on **developing their own toolkits and learn by doing**. In the language of a budding designer, common goals would be to build stronger design skills through learning how to use and apply the design process to a case study. Through an analysis of **objectives** and **constraints** for this concept, we were able to narrow down on our problem statement:

## Ideating around the campfire üî•

With a more narrowed focus on the problem we wanted to solve, we could now start ideating on potential solutions to fill this gap. We began ideating under the theme: **Gaining confidence as a budding designer**. With this theme, we came up with as many ideas as possible using digital sticky notes. While also keeping in mind the problem statement, we came up with sub-themes to help keep us on track while ideating:

1. Getting over imposter syndrome & gaining more confidence
2. Becoming specialised in one aspect of design (ex. I‚Äôm a designer, specialised in UX research)
3. Portfolio building, knowing where to start, building case studies and projects

![image](/assets/slice/slice-4.webp)

After coming up with numerous ideas for Figma plugins, apps and files, we narrowed our list down to our top ideas by voting on our favourite ideas based on feasibility, innovation, and originality. Some of our top ideas included:

- A plugin with portfolio templates to get started üìì
- A plugin that gives provides motivational, funny and uplifting quotes as you design ‚ú®
- A fun quiz (similar to Buzzfeed quizzes) to figure out what type of designer you are, then links you to similar designers to learn more ü§™

And last but not least, our **favourite** idea:

> A Figma plugin that asks questions and keeps track of progress throughout the design process. Eventually helping to build the foundation for case studies afterwards ‚≠êÔ∏è

`Phase Two`
# How will a designer use this plugin?

## Onboarding user flow

To begin our prototyping phase, we began by creating a user flow diagram in order to organise our ideas more clearly. Creating a user flow chart helped us understand and visualise the user experience more clearly, and allowed us to consider all aspects of our plugin from start to finish. Firstly, we outlined the framework for our onboarding flow, from installing the plugin, to beginning a design project.

## Design process user flow
After creating our user flow for the onboarding experience, we revisited the five step design process for the plugin itself, to outline the design stages that users undergo. For each stage in the design process, we included tips and notes associated with each stage to act as notifications for users. While coming up with the tips, we asked ourselves: How can we make the information digestible and motivate our users?

`Phase Three`

# Visualising helpful, playful and simple

## Wireframing

Following the steps outlined in our user flow, we created wireframes to better visualise how the flow of our plugin. Main features we wanted to highlight in the wireframes included:

- User onboarding process and personalisation
- Easy to follow step-by-step design process
- Ability to add new slices to each phase of the process
- Ability to track progress
- Useful links and resources along the way

![image](/assets/slice/slice-7.webp)

Through our wireframing, we made sure to lean back on our problem statement, objectives, and constraints. Some questions we asked ourselves to stay on track were:

> Does this add value to our plugin and help solve our overarching problem? Is the flow intuitive and easily digestible? Would this feature be accessible to all new designers? Is this feasible to implement as a plugin?

## Visual design
When curating our style-guide, we wanted to ensure that the visual brand of our plugin matched our goals and objectives. We decided to use **blue** and **teal** as our primary colours to match the functional aspects of our product: a tool that helps individuals learn about the design process and productively develop their design skills. Additionally, we used **brighter secondary colours** to convey a friendly and welcoming visual image. This was important as we wanted our brand to be easily approachable and accessible to new designers.

## Why Slice?
The name Slice comes from the idea of breaking a large component down into smaller, more digestible chunks. For a new designer, starting a design project can often be overwhelming and they may not know where to start. Therefore, we want to break the process down, slice by slice.

Applying the visual elements of our brand to our high-fidelity mockups, we created a prototype of better showcase the flow of our plugin. Here‚Äôs how our plugin fits into the Figma UI.

`Phase Four`

# Introducing: Slice üçâ

## An engaging onboarding experience
Our plugin starts out with a SSO experience. For new users, they can create an account, and select a designer level (new designer, junior designer or senior designer). These different user types allow Slice to cater towards the users‚Äô specific design project needs.

    <img src="/assets/slice/slice-11.gif" class="img-portrait">
</div>

## Easily integrate with a design project
After setting up their account, users can create a project or select existing Figma projects to use Slice with. Users will also select a phase of the design process to begin with (empathise, ideate, define, prototype, test)

<div class="portrait">
    <img src="/assets/slice/slice-12.gif" class="img-portrait">
</div>

## Guiding users through the design process
The plugin highlights each slice of the five-step design process, starting from Empathy and ending with Test. Using the checklist, designers can easily track their progress. To learn more about each slice, they can read up on useful resources.

## Receive tips and notifications
Throughout your project, users will receive notes from Slice with design tips, specifically catered to to the stage in the design process users are in.

## Effortlessly create a case study
Once users complete a design project, Slice creates a summary of their project on a separate page, with saved screenshots, presented in the form of a slideshow. This takes the user‚Äôs work throughout each step in the design process. For new designers especially, this summary can help them break into design easily and gain confidence not only with the process but also within themselves.

`Phase Five`

# Packing up our learnings and takeaways 
Even upon completion of the product, lingering questions remain regarding the feasibility of our plugin. Despite our best efforts to anticipate and address potential challenges, the dynamic nature of design and technology presents ongoing opportunities for reassessment and refinement. Some questions posed were:

- Can our plugin be engaged with immediately, or does it require a learning curve?
- How does it build upon existing ideas to show us something novel and valuable? 
- Does the idea encourage others to engage with it in interesting ways?

## Key learnings
> **Collaborating with new people** ‚Äî Effective communication and collaboration was essential for our team, especially being remote. We learned to communicate about each others‚Äô goals and understand everyone‚Äôs strengths.

> **Designing a plugin** ‚Äî Despite having experience with mobile and web applications in the past, this was the first time we designed a plugin for Figma. This required a bit of research on how plugins were accessed, how they functioned within the Figma ecosystem, and what their limits on functionality were.

> **How to make quick decisions** ‚Äî Due to the fact that we only had 48 hours to create a solution, it was crucial that we didn‚Äôt spend too long on any individual task, and that we followed a streamlined process. Additionally, we used a polling system to efficiently make design decisions.
