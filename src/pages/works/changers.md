# How can we make donating an engaging and transparent experience while ensuring funds reach and positively impact local grassroots campaigns?

## Overview

I'm a firm advocate for using design as a tool for social impact, and my design work (like myself) are never ethically neutral. I've been fascinated by the concept of **"micro money"** for quite some time, and noticed that most products leveraging spare change fin-tech (rounding up purchases to the nearest dollar) are focused on investing. Seeing a gap in the market for this emerging tech and inspired by my personal mission of **using tech for good**, I aimed to create a platform that allows users micro-donate their spare change to charitable organisations.

> The **high-level goal** of this project was:
>- Create an end-to-end mobile application with a viable business model and strong value proposition
>- Reframe the practice of donating to charity from abstract and trust-based to empowering and transparent

## The Problem
Popular crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe often lack features that support **micro-donations** or **round-up** options, preventing users from making smaller contributions that add up over time. Additionally, these platforms don't specifically cater to Mutual Aid or grassroots organisations, leaving a gap in support for smaller, **community-focused campaigns**. Social media platforms, which Mutual Aid groups frequently use to promote their causes, are subject to **algorithms that may not consistently push content**, making it hard for donors to discover and engage with these campaigns.

Moreover, without a centralised platform, Mutual Aid organisations struggle to reach a broader audience and gain the support they need. This **fragmentation** and **lack of transparency** can deter donors from contributing, as they cannot easily track the impact of their donations.

## The solution
To create a more effective way to support grassroots causes, we need a platform that allows for micro-donations and provides a centralised hub for Mutual Aid organisations. The solution is thus, an end-to-end mobile app that donates usersâ€™ spare change to local Mutual Aid organisation campaigns.

>How can we ensure that a donation platform targeting grassroots campaigns offers transparency, ease of use, and support for round-up micro-donations, enabling users to contribute effectively while tracking the impact of their giving?
