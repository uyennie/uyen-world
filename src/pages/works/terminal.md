Terminal is a fictional design exhibition. The show unpacks MADA studentsâ€™ experience of spending 18 months in a terminal-like space, and seeing it as an essential period in critical thinking and making. The identity of Terminal is inspired by digital, grid-based communication systems, such as LED-signage and ASCII and aims to provide the elements and ideas into the physical room. The identity of Terminal is exploring the idea of a shared space, both physical and digital.
