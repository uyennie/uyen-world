## [CONTENT?]

`Dec 2022`
`web`
`ui/ux`

Our social feed is made of algorithmically constituted recommendations and advertisements of what we should read, who we should know and how we should spend our time. It’s easy to say “there’s a lot of ads online,” and “social media is overwhelming,” but what if we could visualise it? What if these algorithms hidden underneath social media applications were presented in a way that we could comprehend? 

Thus, [CONTENT?] is a microsite and immersive experience that aims to visually emulate the overload of information that we are imbued with online and especially in social media spaces. I hope to leave participants questioning: Are we really empowered by these digital systems? Or are we constrained by them? 

Works best on a full-screen desktop using Google Chrome. Please check your settings to allow permission for camera access!

As media becomes increasingly pervasive, how much of the content in our social feed is from pages or people that we willingly follow and subscribe to?
In the OVERLOAD section of the microsite, users are encouraged to read and interact with the information on the screen as they would with any social media platform and wait as they are suddenly bombarded with an influx of content that they ultimately cannot control or delete every time they blink.

How can this content no longer affect us when we dwell on it for too long?
In the OVERWHELM section of the microsite, the words presented on the user’s screens will disappear if they have “focused too much” on it (i.e. not blinking). The content will only return once they have looked away or blinked again.
