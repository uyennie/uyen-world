## [CONTENT?]

[CONTENT?] is a microsite and immersive experience that aims to visually emulate the overload of information that we are imbued with online and especially in social media spaces. Split into two parts: OVERLOAD and OVERWHELM, the site uses machine learning and facial recognition technology to detect the user’s blinking patterns. This creates speculative scenarios that exposes the algorithmic mechanisms used by social media, through which a user’s online experience increasingly becomes obsessive and overwhelming. Works best on a full-screen desktop using Google Chrome. Please check your settings to allow permission for camera access!
