## The challenge

This campaign delves into the realm of ethical consumerism and its significance for modern online shoppers. With growing concerns about ethics and sustainability, particularly among younger demographics, there's a palpable shift towards conscious consumption. However, the challenge isn't merely to solve the complexities of ethical shopping, but rather to provide users with a **resource** that **simplifies** the process, empowers them to align their purchases with their values, and fosters a sense of **accountability** towards sustainable practices. 

> **How might we design an app that seamlessly integrates ethical ratings into users' shopping experiences, while maintaining an easy-to-use interface that guides and empowers even the most novice ethical shoppers?**


## My role

My role in this project covers:
- UX Research
- UI Design
- Brand designer


`Phase One`
# Understanding the Ethical Shopping Landscape

## Research
My research began with a survey distributed to 15 participants, each falling into one of the following categories:

1. Participants who actively seek out ethically sourced products.
2. Participants who are interested in ethical shopping but find it challenging to implement.
3. Participants who have limited knowledge or awareness of ethical shopping practices.

The objective of my research was to **gain insights into the ethical shopping habits, challenges, and attitudes of individuals across different levels of engagement with ethical consumerism.**

## Research findings

From my research I was able to identify a trend of various pain points felt by participants from all three research groups. I’ll use these pain points to **guide my decision making** when designing the premise of the product to ensure that I’m creating satisfying solutions for the users.

After analysing these pain points, it became evident that developing a **Google Chrome extension** would be a more practical and accessible solution for addressing users' needs in the realm of ethical shopping. The extension format allows for **seamless integration** into users' existing online shopping experiences, providing immediate access to ethical ratings and information without the need for downloading and navigating a separate app.

> **How might this Google Chrome extension seamlessly integrate ethical ratings and information into users' online shopping experiences, fostering informed and conscious purchasing decisions while maintaining ease of use and accessibility?**
