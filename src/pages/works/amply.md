## The challenge

This campaign delves into the realm of ethical consumerism and its significance for modern online shoppers. With growing concerns about ethics and sustainability, particularly among younger demographics, there's a palpable shift towards conscious consumption. However, the challenge isn't merely to solve the complexities of ethical shopping, but rather to provide users with a **resource** that **simplifies** the process, empowers them to align their purchases with their values, and fosters a sense of **accountability** towards sustainable practices. 

> **How might we design an app that seamlessly integrates ethical ratings into users' shopping experiences, while maintaining an easy-to-use interface that guides and empowers even the most novice ethical shoppers?**


## My role

My role in this project covers:
- UX Research
- UI Design
- Brand designer


`Phase One`
# Understanding the Ethical Shopping Landscape

## Who's seeking out ethically made items?
My research began with a survey distributed to 15 participants, each falling into one of the following categories:

1. Participants who actively seek out ethically sourced products.
2. Participants who are interested in ethical shopping but find it challenging to implement.
3. Participants who have limited knowledge or awareness of ethical shopping practices.

The objective of my research was to **gain insights into the ethical shopping habits, challenges, and attitudes of individuals across different levels of engagement with ethical consumerism.**

## Research findings

From my research I was able to identify a trend of various pain points felt by participants from all three research groups. I’ll use these pain points to **guide my decision making** when designing the premise of the product to ensure that I’m creating satisfying solutions for the users.

After analysing these pain points, it became evident that developing a **Google Chrome extension**, named Amply, would be a more practical and accessible solution for addressing users' needs in the realm of ethical shopping. The extension format allows for **seamless integration** into users' existing online shopping experiences, providing **immediate access** to ethical ratings and information without the need for downloading and navigating a separate app.

> **How might Amply, a Google Chrome extension, seamlessly integrate ethical ratings and information into users' online shopping experiences, fostering informed and conscious purchasing decisions while maintaining ease of use and accessibility?**

`Phase Two`
# Visualising the problem

Before designing, I wanted define who a possible user might be and why they would want to use this product. I created user personas with two of the main consumers identified during the research phase so that I could have a **reference point** throughout my design process and bring the app design back to my user and what would be helpful for them.

## What are some habits of the main consumers of this product?

## How are the users going to navigate a Chrome extension?

Using my user personas, I wanted understand the screens I needed to prototype and what information would be presented at each step, I drafted a quick task flow to **get a better understanding of how my user would onboard onto the app.**


## Turning the Amply Chrome Extension: From Static Display to Conversational AI 

After mapping out the user task flow for the Amply Chrome extension, we recognised an opportunity to enhance the user experience by leveraging a conversational approach through the "Ask Amply" function. Rather than relying solely on traditional display methods for ethical ratings, we aimed to make Amply more **engaging, friendly, and approachable** by introducing an **AI-driven conversational interface**. This shift allowed users to interact with Amply in a more natural and intuitive manner, fostering a sense of dialogue and collaboration in their ethical shopping journey. By integrating AI suggestions into the "Ask Amply" function, we empowered users to ask questions and receive personalised recommendations, creating a more dynamic and interactive experience that aligns with the evolving needs and preferences of modern online shoppers.

> **We are evolving beyond static displays to a dynamic conversational experience with 'Ask Amply', embracing the power of AI suggestions, fostering a more engaging, friendly, and approachable interaction for users.**
