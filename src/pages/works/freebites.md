# How can we enhance free food sharing and integrate it into the vibrant campus culture at Monash University?

## Overview
Monash University hosts numerous events throughout the year, often providing **free food** to students. Currently, information about these events is shared through a **Monash-non-affiliated Facebook group** called Monash Stalkerspace. To streamline the process and create an official, Monash-recognised platform for sharing free food events, the university intends to launch a new app called **FreeBites**. This app aims to centralise information from various campus entities, including clubs, societies, student unions, local restaurants, and the community, making it easier for students to discover and access free food offerings.

The below depicts how information about free food events is currently being distributed:

> How can we effectively centralise and streamline the sharing of free food events at Monash University, transitioning from the current reliance on a Monash-non-affiliated Facebook group, Monash Stalkerspace, to an official, Monash-recognised platform?
