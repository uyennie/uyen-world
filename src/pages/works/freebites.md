# How can we enhance free food sharing and integrate it into the vibrant campus culture at Monash University? 

## Overview
Monash University hosts numerous events throughout the year, often providing **free food** to students. Currently, information about these events is shared through a **Monash-non-affiliated Facebook group** called Monash Stalkerspace. To streamline the process and create an official, Monash-recognised platform for sharing free food events, the university intends to launch a new app called **FreeBites**. This app aims to centralise information from various campus entities, including clubs, societies, student unions, local restaurants, and the community, making it easier for students to discover and access free food offerings.

The below depicts how information about free food events is currently being distributed:

> How can we effectively centralise and streamline the sharing of free food events at Monash University, transitioning from the current reliance on a Monash-non-affiliated Facebook group, Monash Stalkerspace, to an official, Monash-recognised platform?

`Phase One`
# A comprehensive UX Research: How will creating an app improve food sharing on campus? 
Before beginning, I fleshed out a UX research plan, which included a competitive audit and user interviews with usability testing.

> The main research goals were to understand the food sharing process on campus and identify the **different types of users** that might use the app and their **pain points, goals, and needs**.

## Competitive Audit
I conducted a competitive audit to familiarise ourselves with exisisting food sharing apops. The applications researched included other on-campus and local community food sharing apps and seeing what their offerings were.

We observed various aspects where competitors excel:

>1. Enhanced user control and customisation options
>2. **Real-time updates on food availability**
>3. Clear navigation between pages
>4. Efficient connection to free food opportunities
>5. Establishment of trust between food sharers and seekers

## A week of interviewing students and staff
I conducted a total of 6 interviews with students, educators, and community leaders. Those interviews were broken down into 2 parts:

1. Questions aimed at understanding their current user behaviors and experiences with food-sharing apps.
2. Conducting light usability tests to observe how they navigate and interact with a simulated app interface to find or post about food surplus.

>Our objective was to identify common patterns and pain points in the existing food-sharing experience and determine how different user groups can effectively navigate and utilise the app.

## Identifying User Groups
During our research, I categorised the three primary user groups for the upcoming FreeBites app.

1. Individuals experiencing food insecurity (**surplus seekers**)
2. Individuals with surplus food to share (**surplus sharers**)
3. Non-profit organisations and student societies
