## Curology

`2023`
`ui/ux`

In the scope of a university project, I undertook the strategic redesign of the Curology website, recognising its functional foundation and the potential for enhancement. The primary aim was to elevate the user experience, align the design with contemporary trends, reinforce Curology's leadership in personalised skincare, and introduce consistent visual motifs for a more modern aesthetic.

By reshaping the Curology website, I aspired to create a digital platform that not only meets functional requirements but also resonates with a modern audience.
