# Redesigning Curology's Website: A UX Case Study to Enhance Brand Perception

To preface, the final designs made for this project were part of a 2 hour university activity where we had to re-design a website of our choosing. The main purpose of the activity was to practice our Figma skills and learn more about implementing variables and cmponents into our designs. However, I was curious to create a mini UX case study on implementing reasons why a re-design of my chosen brand, Curology, was needed in the first place.

## A need for brand evolution

From looking at the old website it seems like they have a **general and broad tagline** that encompasses their overall skincare brand. I wanted to try and take the re-design in a different direction by making the UI more modern, luxurious, and focused on selling their range of main products. Currently their website looks more like an ecommerce template, I aim to create something more bespoke. The following areas I thought could need focusing on based on these insights were:

> **Product Focus:** By emphasising the range of main products, the redesigned website can streamline the customer journey, making it clear and enticing for visitors to explore and purchase the core offerings. This can lead to increased sales and a more efficient conversion funnel.

> **Storytelling and Lifestyle Appeal:** Shifting the focus from a scientific, ecommerce-centric approach to a more lifestyle-oriented one can help create a compelling narrative. Presenting the products within the context of a luxurious and aspirational lifestyle can resonate with consumers on a deeper level.

> **Aligning with Evolving Trends:** The skincare industry, like many others, experiences design trends that evolve over time. By adopting a more modern look, Curology can stay aligned with current design trends, ensuring that its website remains visually appealing and relevant to contemporary tastes.

## Bespoke storytelling â€“ the final design
Below are the final designs for the new Curology website. I feel that the personalised approach and modern aesthetics contributed to a more memorable and compelling online presence for Curology.
