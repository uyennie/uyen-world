In Your hands is a publication which aims to switch the negative narrative around mental health to one that offers hope and self-compassion. The book guides teenagers by posing a series of questions that helps them recognise harmful habits and behaviours that may contribute to a declining mental health. 

At it's conclusion, the publication invites the reader to create their own mental health manifesto; asking the readers to use these negative thoughts as a starting point to turn into something positive.
